# iQvoc

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jnicklas/carrierwave.png)](http://travis-ci.org/innoq/iqvoc)

iQvoc is a vocabulary management tool that combines easy-to-use human interfaces with Semantic Web interoperability.

iQvoc supports vocabularies that are common to many knowledge organization systems, such as:

* Thesauri
* Taxonomies
* Classification schemes
* Subject heading systems

iQvoc provides comprehensive functionality for all aspects of managing such vocabularies:

* import of existing vocabularies from a SKOS representation
* multilingual display and navigation in any Web browser
* editorial features for registered users
* publishing the vocabulary in the Semantic Web

iQvoc is built with state-of-the-art technology and can be easily customized according to user's needs.

## Getting Started

1. Configure your database via `config/database.template.yml`. Don't forget to rename it to `database.yml`
2. Run `bundle install`
3. Run `bundle exec rake db:create` to create the database
4. Create the necessary tables by running `rake db:migrate`
5. Load some base data by running `rake db:seed`
6. Create `config/initializers/secret_token.rb` based on
   `config/initializers/secret_token.rb.template`, filling in the secret token
   generated by `bundle exec rake secret`
7. Boot up the app using `bundle exec rails s` (or `passenger start` if you use passenger)
8. Log in with "admin@iqvoc" / "admin" or "demo@iqvoc" / "cooluri" (cf. step #5)
9. Visit the Users section and change the default passwords

## Compatibility

iQvoc is fully compatible with Ruby 1.9.2, 1.8.7 and JRuby 1.6.

## Customization

There are many hooks providing support for your own classes and configuration. The core app
also works as a Rails Engine. The config residing in `lib/iqvoc.rb` provides a basic
overview of the possibilities.
